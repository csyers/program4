Goal: Program a Prototype of a Message Board Forum Application
November 16 ,2016

INCLUDED FILES:
    README - this readme file
    server - server subdirectory
        myfrmd.c - source code of server
        Makefile - makefile for server
    client - client subdirectory
        myfrm.c - source code of client
        Makefile - makefile for client
        SmallFile.txt - link to test file 1
        MediumFile.pdf - link to test file 2
        LargeFile.pdf - link to test file 3

This directory contains two subdirectories - one for the client and 
one for the server. To start the server, change into the server 
directory and type the command:

$ make

This will create an executable called myfrmd. To start the server, use
the following commnad:

$ ./myfrmd portno password

where portno is any port (41010 used for testing) and password is any 
string that will be used as the admin password. On another student machine, 
chang into the client subdirectory and type:

$ make

to create the client executable, called myfrm. To run the client, type:

$ ./myfrm hostname portno

where hostname is the hostname of the machine running the server, and portno 
is the port number the server was started with.

From there, follow the prompt at the program to use the message application.

Examples (at client):
please enter username: Chris
please enter new password for new user: password
Enter operation (CRT, LIS, MSG, DLT, RDB, EDT, APN, DWN, DST, XIT, SHT): CRT
new board name: board1
successfully created board
Enter operation (CRT, LIS, MSG, DLT, RDB, EDT, APN, DWN, DST, XIT, SHT): MSG
Enter board name to post on: baord1
Enter message: hello world
Message board baord1 does not exist
Enter operation (CRT, LIS, MSG, DLT, RDB, EDT, APN, DWN, DST, XIT, SHT): MSG
Enter board name to post on: board1
Enter message: hello world
Message appended to board board1
Enter operation (CRT, LIS, MSG, DLT, RDB, EDT, APN, DWN, DST, XIT, SHT): DLT
Enter board name to delete from: board1
Enter message number to be deleted: 0
Message 0 successfully deleted
Enter operation (CRT, LIS, MSG, DLT, RDB, EDT, APN, DWN, DST, XIT, SHT): MSG

Enter operation (CRT, LIS, MSG, DLT, RDB, EDT, APN, DWN, DST, XIT, SHT): APN
Enter board name: board1
Enter file to append: SmallFile.txt
SmallFile.txt
board board1 exists and file board1-SmallFile.txt can be appended. Appending
Enter operation (CRT, LIS, MSG, DLT, RDB, EDT, APN, DWN, DST, XIT, SHT): SHT
password: abc
Server shutdown. Goodbye

Other input sequences are possible as well.


KNOWN ERRORS:

APN does not work with symbolic links. Use regular files.

Sometime when running the server, the following errors will be shown:

./myfrmd: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.18' not found (required by ./myfrmd)
./myfrmd: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.14' not found (required by ./myfrmd)
./myfrmd: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.5' not found (required by ./myfrmd)

This problem has something to do with the environment setup
To fix this problem, type the following commands:

$ source ~lsyers/Public/.cshrc
$ make clean
$ make

This will create a new executable that should be able to run error free.
